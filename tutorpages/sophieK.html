          <h3>Tutor</h3>
          
          <h4>My name is Sophie Kao. I'm currently in 9th grade, and I attend Dublin High School! I wanted to join EEP because I was interested in tutoring English. I want to improve my communication with teaching. I also want to interact with people in a different country. It would be fun to engage with other students. From my own experience, I loved participating in activities, because I found them enjoyable. It was especially those fun activities that really enhanced socialization and made me more open to speak. I want to tutor because I want to create that experience with other students!</h3>
