          <h2>Ethan Fan </h2>
          <h3>Scribes</h3>
          
          <h4>My name is Ethan Fan, a third year at Amador Valley High School. I heard of the EEP program from my mom. I was instantly hooked to the program after learning that the program helped students who struggle with English, a struggle that I myself went through when I immigrated. A little about me, I immigrated to the US in 2017, five years ago, so my Mandarin isn't terrible. And about my passion, piano has always been a passion; it helps me destress and relax during stressful times. Also, I love talking to any and all people, so don't be shy. :)</h3>
