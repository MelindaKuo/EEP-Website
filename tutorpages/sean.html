          <h3>Curriculum Leads</h3>
          
          <h4>Hello! My name is Sean and I'm currently a sophomore at Castro Valley High School. I joined the Tzu Chi EEP as a freshman and I had a great experience last year teaching elementary kids in Taiwan. I initially joined because I wanted some experience tutoring younger children, and I definitely feel that I've learned a lot from the kids as well as other tutors. From tutor training to fundraisers, the sense of community fostered in the EEP is very welcoming and entertaining. Overall, I think EEP is a great program for high schoolers looking to try out something new for themselves and interact with children!</h4>
