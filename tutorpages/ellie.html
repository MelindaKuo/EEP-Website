          <h2>Ellie Wang </h2>
          <h3>Program Leads</h3>

          <h4>Hi, I'm Ellie! I'm a senior at Dougherty Valley High School. I've been a tutor since the start of the program in 2020 and a Program Lead since July 2020. I joined EEP and wanted to make a difference in the program because I am passionate about education and volunteering. I feel extremely lucky to have this opportunity to connect and exchange culture with students in Taiwan. It is so rewarding to be part of a student's learning journey, encouraging them, and watching them improve. 
In my free time, I like to cook/bake, listen to music, and craft. I also enjoy learning STEM subjects and plan to pursue biology as a major in college. </h3>
