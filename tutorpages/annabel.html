          <h3>Curriculum Leads</h3>
          
          <h4>Hello I’m Annabel and I’m a senior at Dublin High! I have decided to return to EEP after my experiences as a tutor for the past two years because I really love working with students and it is really rewarding to see the positive results our teaching has on them. This year, I’m looking forward to working with all of our other amazing tutors as a curriculum lead, and continuing to help students develop their English speaking skills.</h3>
